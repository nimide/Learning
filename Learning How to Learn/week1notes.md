# Learning How to Learn

In this week I learned about the following topics:
- Focused and Diffuse Modes of Learning
- How to Overcome Procrastination
- The Importance of Sleep and Exercise for Learning
- The Importance of Learning over time rather than trying to cram.
- The relationship of working memory and long-term memory.
- A reminder that memorizing things is actually an extremely important and enriching practice.

- Focused and Diffuse Modes of Learning:
  - Focused Mode is exactly what its name implies: a period of time where all mental faculties are engaged with some concept or idea with the intention of understanding it better.
  - Diffuse Mode is very counterintuitive. The idea behind it is the brain is always working on and thinking about the problems that we come face to face with in our every day lives. However, this is not the Focused Mode. Our conscious mind is actually focused onsomething else. This period of time allows our brain to think differently and find unusual and sometimes downright wierd connections betweein the things we already know and the things we are tryingto learn. In other words, these are the periods of times that our brains can creatively approach our problems and help us eventually solve those stubborn ones that just seem to be stumping us in the Focused Mode of Learning.

- How to Overcome Procrastination:
 - The Pomodoro Technique is a phenomenal way of helping our brains cope with procrastination. Rather than continuing for hours and hours, we take short, focused work periods and juxtapose them with short periods of reward. This is mainly for subjects or activities that we loathe taking care of; although this can also be useful as an every-day practice for increased productivity. Vecause the bouts of activity are short enough, we're less likely to be afraid to even start working as many of us are wont to do.

- The Importance of Sleep and Exercise of Learning:
 - Sleep allows our brain to clear away the metabolic toxins that tend to build up during the waking hours. It is also when the brain likes to continue working in Diffuse mode while also moving things that have been learned throughout the day into long-term memory. Moreover, these three processes working in tandem result in the extension and creation of dendrites -- the brain is literally making new, physical connections.
 - Exercise is important it also can increase the growth of new brain cells and strengthen memories and concepts learned. Fascinatingly, exercise can also substitute rich learning environments. This means in the absence of a rich learningn environment, if people will exercise, they can receive the same benefits as if they were in a very rich learning environment.
 
- The Imporatnce of Learning over time rather than trying to cram:
  - To use an anology from the course: Imagine a brick wall. This brick wall is strong, sturdy, resilient. It can withstand almost anything that comes at it. However, this brick wall was not built overnight. It took many hours, possibly days for this beautiful piece of architecture to be built. Now imagine a pile of bricks held together by mortar. That pile is like the concepts and ideas learned through cramming. They may be there, but no one would be foolish enough to call that a wall, let alone a strong wall. Thus learning for mastery must be done slowly, methodically, and consistently.

- The relationship of working memory and long-term memory:
  - Working Memory is what is used when actively workign with a problem or many problems. There is a finite amout of space in this area of memory -- around 4 slots. These slots are taken up by the components of a concept or idea one is trying to learn. One way ov leap-frogging over this seeming barrier to complex and multi-facetted concepts is soething called chunking, which will be furhter explored next week.
  - Long-Term Memory is the type of memroy thast is used to store memories long-term... A noivel concept, I know. Anyway. this type of memory is organized like a massive warehouse with millions and billions of file cabinets. As one can imagine with such a large structure, just filing away the memories is only half of the battle. The other half is finding where in the world the memory resides.

- Memorizing things is an important part of learning and enriching one's life:
  - Memorizing allows us to interact with concepts and ideas on a more intimate level because they become a part of us, something that can be recalled almost instantaneously if not immediately.
