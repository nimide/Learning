  - English prefixes and suffixes (from the Greek and latin)
  - Anatomy (Systemic and Topical)
  - Eponymous Diseases
- Technical
  - Protocols (Acronyms, Description, and ports)
  - Models (not sure if this is what I think it is. I'm trying to think of machine learning models/algorithms, their utility, and best use scenarios.)
